Dr. Halie Rando is an informatician who is interested in identifying new opportunities to use computer science and data science to critically examine our approach to biomedical research.
Right now, she is particularly interested in non-traditional animal models and veterinary medicine. 
Dr. Rando received her PhD in Informatics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019, where she worked with [Dr. Anna Kukekova](https://publish.illinois.edu/kukekova-lab/) to develop a bioinformatic perspective on the famous Russian Farm Fox Experiment, where foxes have been bred since the 1950s to show extreme behaviors, including tame, dog-like behavior. 
In 2020, she joined [Dr. Casey Greene's biological data science lab](https://www.greenelab.com) at the University of Pennsylvania and later the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In Dr. Greene's lab, Halie focused on adapating Manubot (software for collaborative writing) to support fast-moving projects related to COVID-19 and on evaluating the similarities and differences between various direct-to-consumer dog genetic tests.
At Smith, she is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, where she teaches Data Structures (CSC 210) as well as upper-level coursework in databases (CSC 230) and health AI (CSC344bd).
